            <p>Picture this. A train crash occurs that leaves a lot of individuals in critical conditions. Someone decides to dial 911 and the EMT’s are dispatched to provide care to the injured and some are rushed to the hospital’s emergency department. About 5 -6 doctors crowd one patient and examine them and some are taking to the operating room only to realize that there is a bomb in one of the patients. … <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-trauma-surgeon-7399f5a4da7a" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Think back to the last time you visited a clinic or hospital with a problem. How many people were involved with diagnosing and treating you? If you said one, you’d be like the many others who refer to a clinical physician as their sole healthcare provider. However, you’d also be incorrect; they are NOT doing all of that work alone! Instead, pathologists do the behind-the-scenes work required for them to swoop in and save the day. Routine things seen everyday such as blood or urine tests, searches for infection, and allergy diagnoses all involve pathologists! <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-pathologist-6311466133f4" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Whether you’ve heard this from your teachers, siblings or older students, high school really is what you make of it. It’s so much more than just attending your classes and getting good grades. Now more than ever it’s important to get involved in your community whether that be through clubs, extracurriculars or volunteering! While extracurricular opportunities are typically offered through your school, volunteer positions can be a little harder to find. Given that you must complete 40 hours of community service as part of your graduation requirement (in Ontario), it’s important to recognize where to find these opportunities. <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/volunteering-in-high-school-ac698311cd02" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>A large aspect of pursuing post-secondary education consists of financial commitments. Tuition, textbooks, rent… the costs can pile up. While working a job, taking on student loans and diligent saving will serve you well, obtaining scholarships remains an effective way to pay for school by making the most of your current achievements. In this week’s blog, we take a look at a few crucial elements of consideration when applying for scholarships. <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/ensnaring-scholarships-this-summer-92076d14be77" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>If you’re a student you have probably heard of the term, “pre-requisite”. These courses are simply courses that have to be taken before another course is. In other words, the knowledge in the previous course has to be mastered first before they are applied in the current course. Essentially, as a pre-med, every course will probably have a pre-requisite from once you start high school because every math, science or business course will only build on the knowledge you should already have. Science programs will require a pre-requisite and those will require their own set of pre-requisites from your final… <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/high-school-student-course-guide-9e5a25dae7cf" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, extracurricular activities, whether they are volunteering; club; or research positions, have definitely taken a hit. Students have now been introduced to the virtual side of education and we soon followed suit with extracurriculars. There has always been quite an impactful notion that the involvement in these activities opens doors for post-secondary education and beyond — however, with this article representing the beginning of OYMS new series, Careers in Medicine, just how important are they to achieving a profession in medicine? That is, why should students go out of their way, particularly in times… <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/the-importance-of-extracurriculars-f020dc20867a" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
