            <p>Hey I'm Navya, the president of OYMS!</br>
                Some time ago, I realized how confusing it really is to want to go into the health field and have a health career. 
                </br>
                A lot of organizations advocate for the many issues in our health field - there's a lot! However, I think there's a better way to make impact. If there's so many problems, why isn't anyone solving them?
                </br>
                And so, that is why I started the Ontario Youth Medical Society, to solve these problems. To have a team of youth who can help set up events like hackathons to understand issues in the field, and then solve them. To connect youth with people who are currently trying to solve these problems, and understand their perspective.</p>

        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <p>The Youth Medical Society is a team of youth in Ontario who are passionate about making a difference in the medical field. Our mission is to help prospective medical students expand their horizons and get a glimpse into the healthcare field. We want to provide more opportunities to connect with key people in this field and understand the different careers available in this field. We want youth to not only understand the key issues in the health field, but promote a problem solving mindset and solve the issue.</p>
