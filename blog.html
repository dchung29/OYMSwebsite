            <p>It used to be the subject of science fiction but now it’s as real as reality can get; you’ve read the title so you know what I’m talking about: the revolutionary technology of CRISPR. In fact, it was so revolutionary that it earned Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. But what does CRISPR actually mean? What are its applications and drawbacks? … <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/nobel-prize-series-chemistry-2020-e23e6dfb3bf3" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Have you ever thought about the mad scientists behind the everyday science that you learn about in school, or perhaps about who these scientists really are? Rest assured, they are definitely not “mad” but they are intelligent and inspiring people who are essential in developing new scientific discoveries in hopes of uncovering the many unknown facets of the world. <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/2020-nobel-prize-winners-in-medicine-and-physiology-e815244f26e8" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Come one, come all, hear chemistry’s call! In this week’s blog, we continue our series on the Nobel Prizes of 2021 and delve into the chemistry side of things. Discover the scientists and specialists contributing to the science that lays the bedrock for so much medical study and practice. This year’s Nobel prize in Chemistry went to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for “the development of asymmetric organocatalysis” (as announced to the public on October 6th, 2021 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, who made the decision). <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/2021-winners-of-the-nobel-prize-in-the-field-of-chemistry-d2603cec59e9" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Have a passion for problem-solving through design, solving the world’s biggest healthcare issues, and even bringing some business into the mix? Then McMaster iBioMed may be the right choice for you! But what’s this program all about? We’ve got everything from what makes the program unique as well as how to apply and some drawbacks. Before we dive in, I’d like to thank Saakshi Arvikar, Fatim Kalogo, and Helen Peng who took the time to meet with me and share their experiences! <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/lets-talk-about-mcmaster-ibiomed-922e202bd4f8" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Behind every doctor and physician, there are several different people who are responsible for the behind-the-scenes work which includes taking physical exams, administering diagnoses, talking to the patient, ordering and reading tests, and many other important tasks. Every physician is composed of an essential team who work together with the physician to help determine the best care plan for their patient and it is always best to get advice and input from other perspectives and sources who can have sufficient knowledge and background in the field. … <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/lets-talk-about-mcmaster-s-physician-assistant-program-be7ac130ffef" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>When asking students interested in a career in healthcare or medicine what their plans are after graduating high school, the answer is often overwhelmingly “I want to go into science.” Well, the truth is that “science” is pretty diverse. Do they mean they want to pursue a program in physics or biology? Kinesiology or environmental sciences? Chemistry or neuroscience? Although “science” can be a blanket term for plenty of different areas, and it can be difficult to choose just one to focus on as high school wraps up, these students don’t necessarily have to. … <a class = whitelink href="https://ontarioyouthmedicalsociety.medium.com/lets-talk-about-mcmaster-integrated-sciences-isci-6699c7515783" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
